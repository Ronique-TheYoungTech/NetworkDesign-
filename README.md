# NetworkDesign- 
These labs are designed to demonstrate my hands-on skills and knowledge in networking concepts, protocols, and technologies. By completing these labs, I aim to showcase my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world networking scenarios, and to develop practical skills that can be applied in a production environment.
